# Image Classification via Transfer Learning

This repository contains code for image classification using transfer learning.

## Introduction

The code utilizes TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets for training and evaluating an image classification model. It uses the "cats_vs_dogs" dataset and applies transfer learning using the MobileNetV2 architecture.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow Datasets
